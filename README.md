My Crowd Simulation Game

This is My Crowd Simulation Game Using Unity Engine.

Its using Menge Algorithm Architecture.
1. For Goal Selection = I am using WanderingBehaviour for randomly move NPC.
2. For Plan Adaptation and Computation =  I am using ObstacleAvodiance for detecting object and CrowdSeparation for detecting another NPC.
3. All Calculation Implemented On Steering so there will be blend and prioriy for Wandering, Obstacle, and Separation.


You can just download and open the project on unity, then all done.
